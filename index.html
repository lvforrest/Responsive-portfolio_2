                <p>     Hello welcome to my page! I hope once you leave this page you'll have an understanding
                        of who I am and what I plan on accomplishing.I'm a 26 year-old graduate of Hollins University with a Bachelor's of Arts in Biology.
                        After graduation, I began working in a toxicology as a lab technician and then promoted
                        to a first reviewer. These past 4 years at my current job provided me an opportunity to use
                        my degree and enhanced my scientific knowledge, but I'm ready to take on a new career in tech.
                        I'm excited to dive in to the world of tech and learn all that I can to enhance my skillset.</p>
                     <br>
                    <p> Outside of my professional life, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Also I like to 
                        go to the gym, travel, attending festivals. Please take a look at my portfolio and feel free to 
                        contact me to discuss details.</p>
